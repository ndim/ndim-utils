========================================================================
Contents:
==============================

  admin-py/
    Some admin tools written in python. Mostly whois and DNS stuff.

  cdburn/
    Burn CDs without clicking and remembering all those options.

  misc/
    Miscellaneous helpers programs.

========================================================================
I build and install it as follows:
==============================

      /---------------------------------------------\

	./autogen.mk
	./configure \
		--prefix="$HOME/root/ndim-utils"
	make
	make install

      \---------------------------------------------/

Then I have a few symlinks to the scripts in $HOME/root/ndim-utils/bin
in ~/.arch-params and other places.


========================================================================
Stuff to fix
==============================

 - seperate independent parts into independent modules
   (e.g. the tla scripts and the palm hotplug scripts)
