.SH "NAME"
one \- write file
.I "one.tmp"
into current dir until a write error

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B "one"
writes a file
.I "one.tmp"
in the current directory until a write error occurs (such as disk full, quota exceeded).

.SH "BUGS"
The content being written is non-zero, but the same 1MB block is repeated over and over, so some modern filesystems like ZFS might compress this away into nothing.

.SH "AUTHOR"
Hans Ulrich Niedermann <hun@n\-dimensional.de>
