.SH "NAME"
one \- write file
.I "one.tmp"
into current dir until write error

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B "one"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B "one"
writes a file
.I "one.tmp"
in the current directory until a write error occurs (such as disk full, quota exceeded).

The content being written consists of non-zero blocks, and all 1K blocks are distinct as long as less than 2**64 1K blocks have been written. This should prevent modern filesystems' (like e.g. ZFS) block deduplication from compressing this file away into nothing.

This makes
.B "one"
useful to fill a filesystem, which zero based approaches like

.BI "dd if=" "/dev/zero" " of=" "zero.tmp" " bs=" "1M"

are not.

.SH "BUGS"

Block content should be more random to prevent filesystem level compression from working.
