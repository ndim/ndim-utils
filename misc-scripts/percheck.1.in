.SH "NAME"
percheck \- show the permissions of a file and all directories leading to it

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B "percheck" <file> ...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B "percheck"
prints a list of the permissions of a file and all the directories leading to it from the root directory. It does so by repeatedly running dirname(1) on the file name to get a list of directories. Then that list of directories is given to
.I "ls \-l"
and its output is printed.

If
.B "percheck"
is given multiple parameters, it examines all the given files, separating the outputs with an empty line.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

Your web server is running as user www-data and cannot deliver the home page of user
.I "foo"
\&. Find out why:

 [foo@host:~]$ percheck public_html/index.html
 drwxr-xr-x   26 root root  1024 Oct  6 00:25 /
 drwxr-xr-x   21 root root  4096 May  5  2005 /home
 drwx------  290 foo  bar  28672 Dec  1 07:53 /home/foo
 drwxr-xr-x    9 foo  bar   4096 Nov 29 15:01 /home/foo/public_html
 -rw-r--r--    1 foo  bar     78 Dec  7  2004 /home/foo/public_html/index.html
 [foo@host:~]$

It looks like someone locked out the web server from the user\'s home directory. The fix will be to add an x bit to the
.I "/home/foo"
directory.
